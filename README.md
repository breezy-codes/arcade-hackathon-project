# Arcade Games Hackathon-in-a-Box

**Arcade Games Hackathon-in-a-Box** is a repository created for a hackathon event that allowed Deakin University students to enhance their skills in game development using SplashKit, Agile methodologies, and GitHub. This hackathon provided participants with a collaborative environment to develop arcade-style games and gain experience with industry-relevant tools and practices.

View the GitHub guide on the [Hackathon Guide Page](https://splashkit.io/arcade-hackathon-project/1-github-guide/) on SplashKit.

## About the Event

The **Arcade Game Hackathon Trial** was conducted as a pilot event to prepare students for future capstone projects and strengthen their understanding of core development tools and practices. The hackathon combined pre-built components, Agile practices, and a structured workflow, allowing participants to focus on adding features and enhancing gameplay in pre-existing games.

### Event Highlights

- **Skill Development**: Students practiced SplashKit, Agile methodologies, coding, and GitHub in real-time scenarios.
- **Project-Based Learning**: Participants worked on real game prototypes, preparing them for larger projects.
- **Collaborative Setting**: Students had the opportunity to work closely with peers in a creative and supportive environment.

## Games in This Repository

This repository includes several arcade-style games developed in C++ and C# that were modified, enhanced, and expanded upon during the hackathon. These games remain accessible for further exploration, learning, and development:

### C++ Games

- **Fight Game**: A fast-paced action game where players engage in combat, testing agility and reaction time.
- **Flappy**: A classic endless runner where players control a flapping character, navigating obstacles for as long as possible.
- **Lost in Space**: A space survival adventure where players must dodge obstacles and survive in a hostile environment.

### C# Games

- **Lost in Space**: The same space adventure, recreated in C#, showcasing language-specific coding practices and implementation differences.

## Running the Games

Each game includes specific setup instructions, but general steps are provided below:

1. **Install SplashKit SDK**: Ensure that SplashKit is installed. Follow the [SplashKit Installation Guide](http://www.splashkit.io/installation/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/arcade-games-hackathon-in-a-box
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Game Folder**:

   ```bash
   cd arcade-games-hackathon-in-a-box/games/{game-folder}
   ```

4. **Build and Run the Game**:
   - For C++ games:

     ```bash
     skm g++ main.cpp -o game
     ./game
     ```

   - For C# games:

     ```bash
     skm dotnet run
     ```
